# My *Random* Friends

This project was created as a part of a course about React fundamentals. This displays a list of randomly generated "robots"(as image) and is using an included file to populate the entries. This can showcase the power of react, simplifying and streamlining the development time needed to build a UI component.

To run this project you need to have `nodejs` and `npm` installed in your system and the application can be launched by running `npm start` if you like to develop locally or you can follow the URL in the "about" to check a live version of the application
